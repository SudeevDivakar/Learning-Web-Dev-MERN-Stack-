    <p>
        Vinícius José Paixão de Oliveira Júnior (born 12 July 2000), commonly known as Vinícius Júnior or Vini Jr.
        (Brazilian Portuguese: [viˈnisjuz ˈʒũɲoʁ]),[3] is a Brazilian professional footballer who plays as a winger for
        La Liga club Real Madrid and the Brazil national team. Considered one of the best players in the world, he is
        known for his speed, strong dribbling abilities, and playmaking skills.[4][5][6][7][8]

        Born in São Gonçalo, Vinícius began his professional career at Flamengo, where he made his senior debut in 2017,
        at age 16. A few weeks later, Vinícius was the subject of a transfer to La Liga club Real Madrid, for whom he
        signed for in a £38 million deal, which was a national record for an U-18 player.[9] The transfer was made
        effective after his 18th birthday, with Vinícius debuting for the club in 2018–19. By his fourth season,
        Vinícius had established himself as a prominent member in Real Madrid's squad, helping the club win the 2021–22
        La Liga title[10] and scoring the winning goal in Real Madrid's 2022 UEFA Champions League final win.[11]

        At his youth stage for Brazil, he was a key player in the victory at the 2015 South American U-15 Championship
        and 2017 South American U-17 Championship, finishing as leading goalscorer in the latter competition. He made
        his senior debut in 2021 and helped his nation to a runner-up finish at the 2021 Copa América and represented
        them at the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar.
