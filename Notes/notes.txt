The internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate via TCP/IP.

The world wide web is an information system where documents and other resources are available 
over the internet.
Documents are transferred via HTTP.

Web server is a computer system that can satisfy requests on the web .

The client is the computer that accesses the server.

The server sends back instructions to display the code and the web browser displays it in human 
readable format.

Front end is focused on the tools running in the browser (html,css,js)

Backend is focused on the tools running in the server .

HTML is used to create web contents.

CSS helps us add designs to html contents.

JS helps to bring life to the html elements and helps them be active. 

HTML helps to desbribe the structure of a document.(It is a markup language)
Helps to bold elements, make elements links, etc.

Any unstructured text added to a html file gets added to the html webpage as it is.
Adding text in between tags helps to add the data onto the webpage in a structured manner.

(Syntax)
<b>....</b> 
Used to bold all the text present in between it.

Use developer.mozilla.org to search up stuff about web development (It's a wikipedia for web dev)

(Syntax)
<p>....</p>
Used when spacing of text is required. Different paragraph tags occur in different lines.

(Syntax)
<h1>...</h1>
<h2>...</h2>
.
.
.
<h6>...</h6>
Used to add headings onto the webpage. 
Size gradually decreases from h1 to h6.
General rule of thumb to use these headings is to use smaller headings to represent subheadings of the parent heading.
For eg.) <h2> would be a subheading of <h1>
And usually only one <h1> heading tag is used in the webpage.

A html boilerplate(skeleton) needs to be followed in order for the html document to be valid.

The structure is as follows:
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>...</title>
    </head>

    <body>
        <---content goes here--->
    </body>
</html>

Doctype helps us specify that we want to use the latest version of html
<html> is the highest level element used and all are other elements are present within this tag. Permitted tags are <head> and <body>. 
<head> only contains data that doesn't show up on the webpage (aka metadata)
<body> contains the contents of the webpage 

(Tip)
!+<tab_key> : returns the html boilerplate. Use it to save time.

(Tip)
ctrl+shift+p : After this, type format document and the html document gets automatically formatted.

(Syntax)
<ol>....</ol> : stands for ordered list and has numbers
<ul>....</ul> : stands for unordered list and has bullet points instead of numbers
<li>..</li> : represents a single element in the list.
You can also have nested lists by adding ul or ol under a list item.

Attributes are data that you can pass inside an html tag. 

(Syntax)
<a href=".....">......</a>
Anchor tag
This creates a link to a specified attribute(href)
When specifying a link, make sure you mention the https://www or else it will search for a file in the directory.

(Syntax)
<img src="...">
Places an image onto the webpage
This is the first tag which does not have a closing tag.
We can also add an alt attribute which gives a decription of the src attribute in case our src attribute is not able to load.

To write comments in html, use <!-- .... -->
