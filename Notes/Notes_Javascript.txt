PRIMITIVE TYPES:
The Basic Building Blocks of JavaScript.
The different primitive data types are:
i)Number
ii)String
iii)Boolean
iv)Null
v)Undefined 
Note:- Symbol and BigInt are two other data types.


When we start out with javascript, we'll be using the console on chrome.
The console is a Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop


clear() - Used to clear the console.
typeof(n) - Single operand function which returns the datatype of a given operand. 
// are used to make single line comments in javascript


Numbers in JavaScript:
->Only one number type in javascript 
->Positive/negative numbers
->Whole numbers
->Decimal Numbers
->Can have basic math operations like +,-,*,/,%,**
->Follows operator precedence 
->Exponentation is carried out by **
->NaN stands for Not a Number (Used for values like 0/0 or 1+NaN) (Basically an undefined value)


Variables in javascript store data types so that they can be referenced multiple times throughout the program.
(SYNTAX)
let variable_name = value;
e.g)
let year=1985;


Javascript supports the += format for updating variables.
e.g) let hello = 35;
     hello += 5;      //This results in 40. (Also works for -,/,%,*)


JavaScript also supports i++ and ++i incrementers
let i=5;
let num1=i++;  //This stores the value of num1 as 5, but after this line is executed, the value of i gets updated to 6.
let j=5;
let num2=++j;  //This stores the values of j and num2 as 6.


The const keyword is used to make a variable a constant. This means that once the variable is declared, it's value cannot be changed.
(SYNTAX)
const variable_name = value;
e.g)
const hello=5;    // The value of this variable cannot be changed.

Note : Before let and const, the only way to declare a variable was using the keyword 'var'. Nowadays there is no reason to use it. (Works very similar to let)
e.g) var hello=5; 


Booleans in JavaScript: 
->There are only two values for this datatype.
->These two values are true and false (case sensitive)
e.g) let hello1 = true;
     let hello2 = false;


Note:-Datatypes in javascript can change datatypes when re-initialized.
Typescript does not allow this and enforces strict data typing.


Rules for javascript variable naming:
->No spacing in between
->Cannot start with a digit 
->Can contain $ _ and digits(Cannot start with digits of course)
->Lower Camel Casing is a good practice in javascript (e.g currentDate,currentDate,apartmentResidents)
